# Docker Learning Project

This repository is a simple project created to **learn and practice Docker** â€” specifically, how to create a `Dockerfile`, build Docker images, and run containers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to:
- Understand how `Dockerfile` works.
- Learn how to build Docker images using `docker build`.
- Practice running containers with `docker run`.
- Get comfortable mapping ports between host and container.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Build the Docker Image
In the project root (where the `Dockerfile` is located), run:

```bash
docker build -t my_docker_learning_image .
